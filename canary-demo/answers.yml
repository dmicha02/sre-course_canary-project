# Additional Observations
observations:
  unexpected_behaviors: 
    - "I were in trouble with prometheus which returned No Data."
    - "Thanks to Steve Moss for the workaround : set podMonitoSelector to {} in prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com."
  
  suggested_improvements: 
    - "Maybe ask to set-up some metrics in prometheus/grafana frameworks to best answer to some questions proposed in instructions."
    - "Add a section 'Common Issues' in the instructions."
